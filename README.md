## Homework 1 – Android Basics
1. Create an Android app with an empty activity and set the title to “Homework 1”.
2. Add a static TextView containing your name.
3. Add two input (EditText) fields.
4. Add a “Calculate” button and an output field (TextView). If the button is clicked, the
values entered into the input fields should be added and the sum displayed in the
output field. If an input field does not contain a valid integer number, interpret its
value as 0.
5. Add a “Navigate” button. If the navigate button is clicked, the values in the input
fields are summed up as before (the same rules for invalid inputs apply), but instead
of updating the output field, a new screen is show, and the value is displayed in it.
6. Add a SeekBar and another output field (TextView). If the slider of the SeekBar is
moved, its current value must be displayed immediately in the output field. The
initial value of the output field must correspond to the initial value of the SeekBar.
Note: SeekBars were not yet discussed. Use the online Android developer
documentation (developer.android.com) to learn more on SeekBars and to find the
correct event to listen for.
7. The layout of the App must adhere to the following screenshots. Do not forget to set
the application title in the navigation bar correctly.
8. All input- and output fields must be set to an appropriate initial value (see
screenshots). Use String-constants for all user facing texts.
